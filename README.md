# MUSETTE
## ABSTRACT
_The number of people being enticed towards the field of entertainment is pacing up, especially music. Pondering upon the increase in demand and hidden talents, we have come up with an idea to give people a platform: have singing talents and are unemployed. Named as 'Musette', this platform is more like a hub for freelance singers for transforming their hobbies to a source of income. Our project hovers around the idea of solving unemployment and providing entertaintment. This website is going to provide employment opportunities to a large group of people urging to unwrap their talent. The artists wanting to grab the opportunities have to have an account in the website and upload videos of the songs they sing, be it a cover version or the original. The hirers will be the restaurants, hotels, pubs, bars where the artist can perform or even normal users may be the hirer. The primary target of overcoming the hassle work for hirers of hiring the artists is going to be decreased accordingly increasing employment opportunities and entertaintment too._
### ACCOUNT TYPE
1) Artist
